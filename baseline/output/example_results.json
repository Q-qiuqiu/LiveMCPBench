        "response": "Here’s a detailed guide for your trip to the Forbidden City in Beijing:\n\n### **Parking Information**\nUnfortunately, there are **no parking facilities** within 1 km of the Forbidden City (coordinates: 39.918, 116.397). The area is highly restricted for vehicles due to its historical significance and dense urban environment. We recommend using public transportation or ride-sharing services to reach the site.\n\n---\n\n### **Interesting Attractions Within 1 km**\nHere are some must-visit spots near the Forbidden City:\n\n1. **Nine Dragons Screen (九龙壁)**  \n   - **Distance:** ~700 meters  \n   - **Description:** A stunning carved stone wall depicting nine intricately detailed dragons. This is one of the most iconic architectural features in Beijing, located just outside the Forbidden City’s northern gate.  \n   - **Highlights:** Beautiful craftsmanship, symbolic significance in Chinese culture.\n\n2. **Well of Concubine Zhen (珍妃井)**  \n   - **Distance:** ~1.3 km (slightly outside 1 km radius but worth the short walk)  \n   - **Description:** A historic well where Consort Zhen, a favorite of Emperor Guangxu, was imprisoned and ultimately died. This site offers a poignant glimpse into the tragic stories of imperial palace life.  \n   - **Highlights:** Historical significance, emotional storytelling.\n\n3. **Lao She Memorial Hall (老舍纪念馆)**  \n   - **Distance:** ~1.1 km  \n   - **Description:** A museum dedicated to the famous Chinese writer Lao She, who wrote *Rickshaw Boy* and *Teahouse*. The hall is located in his former residence.  \n   - **Highlights:** Literary history, peaceful atmosphere, great for cultural immersion.\n\n4. **Red Wall Hotel (红墙酒店)**  \n   - **Distance:** ~1.2 km  \n   - **Description:** A 4-star hotel located near the Forbidden City, known for its traditional Chinese architecture and proximity to historical sites.  \n   - **Highlights:** Great for accommodations, offers a glimpse into Beijing’s blend of modern and traditional design.\n\n5. **Toilets & Amenities**  \n   - **Nearby Toilets:**  \n     - **Coal渣 Hutong 42 (West Entrance):** Open 24/7, operated by Beijing Dongcheng District Sanitation Service Center.  \n     - **Unnamed Toilet (39.9104618, 116.3965999):** Free, but no wheelchair access.  \n   - **Café & Restaurant:**  \n     - A small café and restaurant are located nearby (coordinates: 39.9176792, 116.3916031 and 39.9174165, 116.3895043 respectively). Ideal for a quick snack or meal.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n- **Transportation:** Use Beijing Subway Line 1 (Tiananmen East or Tiananmen West stations) to reach the Forbidden City easily.  \n- **Walking:** The area is pedestrian-friendly, so walking is the best way to explore these attractions.  \n- **Timing:** Visit early in the morning to avoid crowds and enjoy the full experience.\n\nEnjoy your trip to the Forbidden City and its surrounding historical wonders!",
