        "response": "Based on the search results, here's what I found:\n\nRegarding Parking:\nUnfortunately, there are no official parking facilities directly recorded within 1km of the Forbidden City. This is because the Forbidden City is in a highly restricted area of Beijing. It's recommended to:\n1. Use public transportation (the nearest subway stations are Tiananmen East or Tiananmen West)\n2. Take a taxi or ride-sharing service\n3. If you must drive, use nearby public parking lots in the surrounding commercial areas and walk to the site\n\nInteresting Places within 1km:\n\nNotable Attractions:\n1. The Palace Museum (故宫博物院) - This is the Forbidden City itself, entrance fee is ¥60\n2. Nine Dragons Screen (九龙壁) - A famous imperial wall carving\n3. Round City (团城) - A historical circular structure\n4. Long Corridor (长廊) - A historic covered walkway\n5. Well of Concubine Zhen (珍妃井) - A historical site with a tragic story\n\nCultural Sites:\n- Laoshe Memorial Museum (老舍纪念馆) - Dedicated to the famous Chinese writer\n\nAccommodation:\n- Red Wall Hotel (红墙酒店) - A 4-star hotel\n- Days Inn Forbidden City (北京香江戴斯酒店)\n- Feel Inn (非凡宾馆) - A hostel option\n\nAmenities:\n- Several cafes and restaurants\n- Multiple public toilets throughout the area\n- A few bars and cafes in the vicinity\n\nFor the best experience, I recommend:\n1. Visit early in the morning to avoid crowds\n2. Use public transportation to reach the site\n3. Plan at least half a day to explore the Forbidden City itself\n4. Visit the Nine Dragons Screen and other nearby attractions afterward\n5. There are several restaurants and cafes in the area for refreshments\n\nRemember that the Forbidden City is an extremely popular tourist destination, so it's best to book tickets in advance and arrive early in the day to avoid the largest crowds.",

                "content": "Based on the search results, here's what I found:\n\nRegarding Parking:\nUnfortunately, there are no official parking facilities directly recorded within 1km of the Forbidden City. This is because the Forbidden City is in a highly restricted area of Beijing. It's recommended to:\n1. Use public transportation (the nearest subway stations are Tiananmen East or Tiananmen West)\n2. Take a taxi or ride-sharing service\n3. If you must drive, use nearby public parking lots in the surrounding commercial areas and walk to the site\n\nInteresting Places within 1km:\n\nNotable Attractions:\n1. The Palace Museum (故宫博物院) - This is the Forbidden City itself, entrance fee is ¥60\n2. Nine Dragons Screen (九龙壁) - A famous imperial wall carving\n3. Round City (团城) - A historical circular structure\n4. Long Corridor (长廊) - A historic covered walkway\n5. Well of Concubine Zhen (珍妃井) - A historical site with a tragic story\n\nCultural Sites:\n- Laoshe Memorial Museum (老舍纪念馆) - Dedicated to the famous Chinese writer\n\nAccommodation:\n- Red Wall Hotel (红墙酒店) - A 4-star hotel\n- Days Inn Forbidden City (北京香江戴斯酒店)\n- Feel Inn (非凡宾馆) - A hostel option\n\nAmenities:\n- Several cafes and restaurants\n- Multiple public toilets throughout the area\n- A few bars and cafes in the vicinity\n\nFor the best experience, I recommend:\n1. Visit early in the morning to avoid crowds\n2. Use public transportation to reach the site\n3. Plan at least half a day to explore the Forbidden City itself\n4. Visit the Nine Dragons Screen and other nearby attractions afterward\n5. There are several restaurants and cafes in the area for refreshments\n\nRemember that the Forbidden City is an extremely popular tourist destination, so it's best to book tickets in advance and arrive early in the day to avoid the largest crowds.",
