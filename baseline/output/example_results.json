        "response": "Based on my search around the Forbidden City in Beijing, here's what I found for your trip planning:\n\n## Parking Facilities\nUnfortunately, no specific parking facilities were found in the immediate 1km radius of the Forbidden City through the OpenStreetMap database. This is actually quite common for historic city centers in Beijing, where parking is often restricted or managed differently. \n\n**Parking Recommendations:**\n- The Forbidden City area has very limited parking due to its location in central Beijing\n- Consider using public transportation (subway lines 1 and 2 stop at Tiananmen East and Tiananmen West)\n- If you must drive, look for parking at nearby shopping centers or hotels, but expect to walk some distance\n- Some hotels in the area may offer parking for guests\n\n## Interesting Places Within 1km of the Forbidden City\n\n### **Tourist Attractions:**\n1. **Nine Dragons Screen (九龙壁)** - A famous decorative wall featuring nine dragons, located very close to the Forbidden City\n2. **Well of Concubine Zhen (珍妃井)** - A historic well with cultural significance related to imperial history\n\n### **Museums:**\n- **Residence of Laoshe (老舍纪念馆)** - Memorial museum for the famous Chinese writer Lao She\n\n### **Hotels (if you need accommodation):**\n- **Red Wall Hotel (红墙酒店)** - 4-star hotel nearby\n- **Grand Hyatt Beijing (北京东方君悦大酒店)** - Luxury hotel option\n- Several other hotels in the area\n\n### **Shopping & Services:**\n- **Beijing Foreign Languages Bookstore (北京外文书店)** - Great for books and souvenirs\n- **Apple Store** - For any electronics needs\n- Various restaurants, cafes, and a Bank of China branch\n\n### **Practical Amenities:**\n- Public toilets available in the area\n- Restaurants and cafes for dining\n\n**Pro Tips for Your Visit:**\n1. The Forbidden City itself is a massive attraction that can take a full day to explore properly\n2. Book tickets in advance online as daily visitor numbers are limited\n3. Consider visiting Jingshan Park (just north of the Forbidden City) for great views\n4. Tiananmen Square is immediately south and worth visiting\n5. The area is very walkable, with many attractions within easy walking distance\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific type of attraction or get more details about any of these places?",

You have access to a single execution tool called 'execute-tool'. You must always use this tool to invoke any of the available MCP tools.\n2. Never call MCP tools directly. Always select the appropriate tool and call it via 'execute-tool'.\n3. Provide accurate and complete responses to the user. You can combine multiple tool calls if necessary, but respond to the user only once.\n4. For each tool call, specify:\n   - server_name: the MCP server hosting the target tool\n   - tool_name: the name of the target tool\n   - params: a dictionary of input parameters for the tool\n\nAvailable MCP tools (choose from these, but always call via 'execute-tool'):\n\n- geocode_address (server: osm-mcp-server): \nConvert an address or place name to geographic coordinates with detailed location information.\n\nThis tool takes a text description of a location (such as an address, landmark name, or\nplace of interest) and returns its precise geographic coordinates along with rich metadata.\nThe results can be used for mapping, navigation, location-based analysis, and as input to\nother geospatial tools.\n\nArgs:\n    address: The address, place name, landmark, or description to geocode (e.g., \"Empire State Building\", \n            \"123 Main St, Springfield\", \"Golden Gate Park, San Francisco\")\n    \nReturns:\n    List of matching locations with:\n    - Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)\n    - Formatted address\n    - Administrative boundaries (city, state, country)\n    - OSM type and ID\n    - Bounding box (if applicable)\n    - Importance ranking\n. Input: {\"address\": {\"title\": \"Address\", \"type\": \"string\"}}\n- reverse_geocode (server: osm-mcp-server): \nConvert geographic coordinates to a detailed address and location description.\n\nThis tool takes a specific point on Earth (latitude and longitude) and returns \ncomprehensive information about that location, including its address, nearby landmarks,\nadministrative boundaries, and other contextual information. Useful for translating\nGPS coordinates into human-readable locations.\n\nArgs:\n    latitude: The latitude coordinate (decimal degrees, WGS84)\n    longitude: The longitude coordinate (decimal degrees, WGS84)\n    \nReturns:\n    Detailed address and location information including:\n    - Formatted address\n    - Building, street, city, state, country\n    - Administrative hierarchy\n    - OSM metadata\n    - Postal code and other relevant identifiers\n.

Results are organized by\ncategory and subcategory, making it easy to find specific types of places. Essential\nfor location-based recommendations, neighborhood analysis, and proximity-based decision making.\n\nArgs:\n    latitude: Center point latitude (decimal degrees)\n    longitude: Center point longitude (decimal degrees)\n    radius: Search radius in meters (defaults to 1000m/1km)\n    categories: List of OSM categories to search for (e.g., [\"amenity\", \"shop\", \"tourism\"]).\n               If omitted, searches common categories.\n    limit: Maximum number of total results to return\n    \nReturns:\n    Structured dictionary containing:\n    - Original query parameters\n    - Total count of places found\n    - Results grouped by category and subcategory\n    - Each place includes name, coordinates, and associated tags\n.

                "content": "Based on my search around the Forbidden City in Beijing, here's what I found for your trip planning:\n\n## Parking Facilities\nUnfortunately, no specific parking facilities were found in the immediate 1km radius of the Forbidden City through the OpenStreetMap database. This is actually quite common for historic city centers in Beijing, where parking is often restricted or managed differently. \n\n**Parking Recommendations:**\n- The Forbidden City area has very limited parking due to its location in central Beijing\n- Consider using public transportation (subway lines 1 and 2 stop at Tiananmen East and Tiananmen West)\n- If you must drive, look for parking at nearby shopping centers or hotels, but expect to walk some distance\n- Some hotels in the area may offer parking for guests\n\n## Interesting Places Within 1km of the Forbidden City\n\n### **Tourist Attractions:**\n1. **Nine Dragons Screen (九龙壁)** - A famous decorative wall featuring nine dragons, located very close to the Forbidden City\n2. **Well of Concubine Zhen (珍妃井)** - A historic well with cultural significance related to imperial history\n\n### **Museums:**\n- **Residence of Laoshe (老舍纪念馆)** - Memorial museum for the famous Chinese writer Lao She\n\n### **Hotels (if you need accommodation):**\n- **Red Wall Hotel (红墙酒店)** - 4-star hotel nearby\n- **Grand Hyatt Beijing (北京东方君悦大酒店)** - Luxury hotel option\n- Several other hotels in the area\n\n### **Shopping & Services:**\n- **Beijing Foreign Languages Bookstore (北京外文书店)** - Great for books and souvenirs\n- **Apple Store** - For any electronics needs\n- Various restaurants, cafes, and a Bank of China branch\n\n### **Practical Amenities:**\n- Public toilets available in the area\n- Restaurants and cafes for dining\n\n**Pro Tips for Your Visit:**\n1. The Forbidden City itself is a massive attraction that can take a full day to explore properly\n2. Book tickets in advance online as daily visitor numbers are limited\n3. Consider visiting Jingshan Park (just north of the Forbidden City) for great views\n4. Tiananmen Square is immediately south and worth visiting\n5. The area is very walkable, with many attractions within easy walking distance\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific type of attraction or get more details about any of these places?",
