    "Question": "Please perform a comprehensive analysis of the audio file located at /root/music/mixkit-retro-game-emergency-alarm-1000.wav. The analysis should include beat tracking, MFCC extraction, and chroma CQT calculation. Upon completion, please provide the resulting data along with a brief summary of the findings.",

    "file_name": "/root/music/mixkit-retro-game-emergency-alarm-1000.wav",
    "Annotator Metadata": {
      "Steps": "1. Load the audio file\n2. Compute the beat track of the audio to understand its rhythmic structure. \n3. Extract the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from the audio to analyze its spectral content.\n4. Compute the Chroma Constant-Q Transform (CQT) to analyze the chromatic content of the audio. \n5. Write a summary document outlining the key findings and insights from the analysis.\n",
